Observation &gt; Reasoning
Errors should not pass silently unless explicitly silenced.
There should be one (and preferably only one) obvious way to do it.
Make the usual case or the right way shorter
but include the wrong way for the rare case where it's the right way.
Wait until the right solution emerges.
